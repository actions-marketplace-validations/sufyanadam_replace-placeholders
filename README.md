# Replace Placeholders GitHub Action

Find and replace for GitHub Actions. Ever wish you could run `sed s/FIND/REPLACE/g` 
recursively in a directory of your project? This action is for you!
Replace all occurrences of placeholders found in files of the provided directory
matching the provided filename pattern with the provided replacement values.

The desired placeholders to replace and their respective replacement values are
passed in as a JSON string. For example:

```
    placeholders: |
      {
        "<APP_NAME>": "my-app",
        "<NAMESPACE>": "my-namespace"
